# Smart Home Automation System

This project demonstrates a home automation system that allows the user to control it using a wireless device such as WI-FI or a mobile phone with WI-FI or Bluetooth. The system allows the user to control both lights and fans individually. It can automatically turn off the main lights and turn on the night light at a specified time. The system allows viewing and controlling the temperature and humidity in the house. The system also contains high-precision protection, as it detects gas leakage and permanent alerts by sending notifications to the phone and turning on the alarm at home. It is also able to determine if there is a fire in the house or a suspicious person has entered the house and trigger alarms if movement is detected at the door of the house. The system is also a provider of artificial intelligence techniques to recognize faces and allow them to enter the house if the place of the person belongs to the house
